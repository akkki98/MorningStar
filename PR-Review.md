# GitHub Copilot Lab – Pull Request Summary & Code Review

## Lab Title

**Using GitHub Copilot for Pull Request (PR) Summary and Code Review**

## Target Audience

Developers, Senior Engineers, Tech Leads, QA/SDETs, DevOps Engineers

## Lab Duration

45 minutes

## Prerequisites

* GitHub repository with at least one open Pull Request
* GitHub Copilot enabled (IDE or GitHub UI with Copilot Chat)
* Basic understanding of GitHub Pull Request workflow

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, participants will be able to:

* Use GitHub Copilot to generate **clear PR summaries**
* Perform **AI-assisted code reviews**
* Identify code quality, security, and performance risks
* Provide actionable review comments
* Improve review speed without compromising quality

## Why Use GitHub Copilot for PR Reviews?

Traditional PR reviews are often:

* Time-consuming
* Inconsistent across reviewers
* Focused on syntax instead of intent

GitHub Copilot helps by:

* Summarizing changes quickly
* Highlighting potential risks
* Enforcing coding standards
* Acting as a "second reviewer"
